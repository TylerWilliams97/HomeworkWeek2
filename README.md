In this assignment i used bootstrap to create a responsive portfolio and contact page.
i used html css and bootstrap to put together a placeholder page for a portfolio

## Updated Portfolio

1. Add Breakpoints

2. Display your full name, email, and phone number

3. Have links to your GitHub profile and LinkedIn profile

4. Have a link to a downloadable PDF of your resume

5. Display at least 2 examples of student work from either deployed projects or homeworks. For each project, make sure you have the following:

    * Project title

    * Link to the deployed version

    * Link to the GitHub repository

    * Screenshot of the deployed application

6. Have a polished, mobile-responsive user interface.

### Design


* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like
  the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
